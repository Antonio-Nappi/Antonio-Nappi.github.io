Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Antonio Nappi and I am a Doctoral Researcher at the Helmholtz Center Munich, where I am conducting research on the development of machine learning methods for the identification of disease subtypes in mental health disorders using computational statistical genetics. I am also participating in training programs and workshops to expand my knowledge and skills in data science and machine learning, and collaborating with other researchers and graduate students on interdisciplinary projects.

Prior to my current role, I worked as a Data Scientist at Skienda, where I developed machine learning and AI models using Python and relevant frameworks, and utilized my expertise in machine learning and AI to extract insights and solve business problems. Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Whitehall Reply, where I developed web applications using technologies such as Angular and Spring Boot, participated in machine learning projects, and demonstrated strong programming skills and the ability to work effectively in a team environment.

I hold a Master's degree in Digital Health and Bioinformatics Engineering from the University of Salerno, where I focused on digital health and machine learning and took courses in statistical learning, machine and deep learning, biomedical images analysis, artificial intelligence, and natural computing. I also completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Salerno, where I learned how to program in various languages and gained an understanding of OOP principles and web development.

In my free time, I enjoy volunteering with AFS "Intercultura", where I have been an active member and have helped organize events and provide support for young students. I have also had the opportunity to participate in AFS exchange programs, including a program in Thailand where I attended school for two months and gained valuable cultural awareness and communication skills.
